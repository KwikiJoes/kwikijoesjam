## Adam's Code Jam
This code was created in early 2024 for [Adam's Code Jam](https://jam.adamlearns.com/).

I am a designer/illustrator who pretends to be a programmer, so this is probably pretty painful to go through. Basically my daughter and I play a game where we have a whole bunch of craft drawers in our house, and we choose three random ones each, then choose a random object we have to create using only those drawers. We have always just used pieces of paper drawn out of a hat that we have to recreate from scratch because they get lost all the time, so this is meant to make everything easier by having a program to do it. 

I also don't really know how to use git and/or GitHub, so I think I am doing things wrong. I apologize...
